	\section{Abstract}
		As music is algorithmically more and more understood , we will eventually encounter a period in which music is in a way mass manufactured by algorithms. Detection of plagiarism through subjective reasoning will therefore be infeasible. What will be the algorithms of the future that will be used for detecting similar songs and what will be the precise measurements for detecting plagiarism. With other words : How similar must a song be so that it can be considered plagiarism? Though there are different realms where music similarity can be questioned , the unified algorithm becomes with each day more and more needed. We introduce the current approaches on detection of similar songs and discuss how they will be put together.
